# Anatomy of a Quarto book

## Quarto books

-   Books are also essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project

-   But a book is different than `format: html` in that it has multiple pages

-   Books and websites are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

-   Books and websites are different in how they treat components: pages vs. cross-referencable chapters for website and books, respectively

## Our turn

::: task
Let's build a book together from all of the documents we've created so far and highlight the following features of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page / change landing page

-   Cross references

-   Sections

-   Appendices
:::

## Your turn

::: task
Pick up where we left off and

-   Give a title to your book.
-   Add a numbered figure and cross-reference it.
-   Add a numbered figure to another chapter, cross-reference it, and observe the numbering scheme

-   [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. It is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, presentations, and personal hobby sites.

-   Publish with `quarto publish`:
